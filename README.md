## Introduction

Implementing decentralized finance on Bitcoin has faced significant challenges. These challenges head-on by allowing users to participate in DeFi while maintaining full control of their Bitcoin assets through the use of multisig escrow. Our project aims to empower users by providing a trustless environment for transactions.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Default privacy mechanisms to protect user identities.

## Technology Stack

- **Bitcoin L1**: Utilizing the Bitcoin network's security and robustness.
- **Multisig Wallets**: Implementing Bitcoinâ€™s multisig functionality for escrow services.
- **JavaScript / Python / rust **: Core development languages for the application.
- **Web3.js / Bitcoin.js**: For blockchain interactions.

## Usage
